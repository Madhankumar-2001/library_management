In this project, which is the management of the library, I have developed logins for users, librarians, and employees. 
The page then advances to their individual login window once they have logged in. 
Through the web page, the user can add, return, and renew the books.
I utilised mysql, javascript, css, php, and html. 
I linked the project using the xampp server.
Each student can scan their ID with a QRCode to enter the website. 
Their attendance will be recorded in an excel sheet that can be used for later purpose.
